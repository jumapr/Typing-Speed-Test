# Typing-Speed-Test
Desktop typing speed test application with GUI implemented using tkinter. Counts the number of words the user correctly types in one minute. Also, keeps track of high score, which is stored in high_score.text. The test_files directory provides four sample texts to type, but more could be added as needed.
